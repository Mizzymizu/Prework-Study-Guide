# Prework-Study-Guide-Webpage
Study course for Module 0 | Bootcamp

## Description

This study guide was created for my prework for the upcoming Bootcamp. It contains notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

Though I did have some previous coding experience while learning HTML/CSS, it was still a great refresher for me to do so again as it has been a couple of months since I've done it. 

And it was great finally learning how to use Git and GitHub. I'm sure knowing how to use my local machine to play around with code is going to be a grat boon to my coding journey. 

And I can't forget about JavaScript! It was the language that I decided I want to learn first, even over Python. And this decision has led to me to choose Full-stack WebDev.

It's going to be a crazy ride full of headaches, but I am convinced that it will be all well worth it in the end.
